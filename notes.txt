There are some mock data in the codebase. Please remove them and use the real data. and 



Load balacne when we are hit by more users beside vertical scaling. 

How big will it become globally?? Can we go that route?

Scaleability??

mcp? app database and so on

Instead of rendering all the data at once, we can use pagination or infinite scroll to load data as needed. or perhapd plot random samples of the data say 2000 events out of XXX and also show the total number of events that were selected. this will help with performance and scalability and also transparancy 

there are some empty folders in the codebase. Please check them if they are needed or not and decide what to do with them. 




The Analytics page (`app/analytics/page.tsx`) currently loads all catalogues and their events on page load, which causes performance issues. Please optimize this by implementing:

1. **Lazy loading**: Only load catalogue metadata initially, not all events
2. **On-demand event fetching**: Load events only when a specific catalogue is selected for analysis
3. **Pagination or limits**: If events must be loaded, implement pagination or reasonable limits (e.g., latest 1000 events)
4. **Caching**: Use the existing `useCachedFetch` hook instead of manual fetch calls
5. **Loading states**: Add proper loading indicators for better UX

The catalogue edit page (`app/catalogues/[id]/edit/page.tsx`) currently only allows editing the catalogue name, but users need access to edit all metadata fields that are available during catalogue import/creation. Please enhance the edit functionality to include:

1. **Full metadata form**: Replace the simple name input with the complete `CatalogueMetadataForm` component that's used during upload
2. **All metadata fields**: Include all fields from the `CatalogueMetadata` interface:
   - Basic info: description, data_source, provider, geographic_region, version
   - Time period: time_period_start, time_period_end
   - Quality: data_quality (completeness, accuracy, reliability), quality_notes
   - Contact: contact_name, contact_email, contact_organization
   - License: license, usage_terms, citation, doi
   - Additional: keywords, reference_links, notes
3. **Pre-populate existing data**: Load and display current metadata values in the form
4. **Update API endpoint**: Ensure the PATCH `/api/catalogues/[id]` endpoint can handle all metadata fields
5. **Validation**: Apply the same validation rules used during catalogue creation

This will allow users to add any missing information or update metadata that may have changed after the initial catalogue import.



The "Max Events to Display" dropdown selector in the map components is not functioning properly. When I click on the dropdown, I cannot see the available options (500, 1,000, 2,000, 5,000 events). This issue appears to be affecting multiple map components including:

- EnhancedMapView.tsx
- CatalogueMap.tsx  
- MapView.tsx (catalogues)
- UnifiedEarthquakeMap.tsx
- MapComponent.tsx (merge)

The dropdown may be hidden behind other UI elements due to z-index issues, or there could be a problem with the SelectContent component rendering. Please investigate and fix the dropdown visibility so users can change the sampling size for performance optimization when viewing large earthquake datasets.
